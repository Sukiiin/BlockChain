## Chocolate Shop dApp - Readme

This project implements a decentralized Chocolate Shop application (dApp) built with Solidity and React. Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to buy and sell chocolates.

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* A code editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Remix).
* A local blockchain environment (e.g., Ganache, Hardhat).
* MetaMask wallet installed as a browser extension.

**Running the dApp:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sukiiin/BlockChain
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
cd chocolate-shop-dapp
npm install
```

3. **Deploy the smart contract:**

* Make sure your local blockchain environment is running.
* Edit the `contractAddress` variable in `ChocolateShopPage.jsx` to point to the deployed contract address (obtained after deployment).
* You can use tools like Remix or Truffle to compile and deploy the contract.

4. **Start the React development server:**

```bash
npm start
```

5. **Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.**

6. **Connect your MetaMask wallet:**

* Click on the "Please connect your MetaMask wallet" button or similar prompt.
* Follow the MetaMask instructions to connect your wallet to the dApp.

7. **Interact with the Chocolate Shop:**

* You should see your account address and chocolate balance displayed.
* Use the "Buy Chocolate" and "Sell Chocolate" buttons to interact with the contract, specifying the desired quantity.

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a basic implementation and may require further development for production use.
* Ensure you understand the security implications of interacting with smart contracts before using real funds.
* Refer to the Solidity and React documentation for further learning on these technologies.

**Further Exploration:**

* You can explore adding features like setting a maximum purchase quantity or implementing a more sophisticated pricing mechanism.
* Consider integrating with a testnet faucet to provide users with test Ether for interacting with the dApp.

This readme provides a basic guide to running the Chocolate Shop dApp locally. You can customize and extend it further based on your specific project setup and functionalities.
